# The input contains a single name. Each name contains only lowercase letters (aâ€“z), 
# no whitespace, a minimum length of 1 character, and a maximum length of 250 characters.
# Output
# The output contains the compact version of the name: any time the same letter 
# appears two or more times in sequence, it must be replaced by a single instance of that letter.
